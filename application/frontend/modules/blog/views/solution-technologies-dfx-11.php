                Today, store and copy data with huge capacity - high speed has become an urgent problem in the world of computing and computer industry. How to enable copy data as quickly as possible with the hard disk drives that have capacity up to several TB?
                <br>
                From the market demand, Greystone Data Systems Vietnam has conducted the research for new generation of Duplicators that supports all types of HDD, SSD with standards PATA, SATA1, SATA2 & SATA3 (6Gbit /s).
                <br>
                In early 2013, Greystone Data Systems Vietnam launched series of DF-X11 Duplicators that can copy program software and data from one (01) Source hard disk drive to eleven (11) Target hard disk drives simultaneously. This machines operate at the copy speeds up to 14GB mirror / min (SATA3) as well as supports more functions. The machines operation stably with all kinds of HDD and SSD drives, standard ATA and SATA1,2,3. The speed and quality of the machine have met the very high requirements for clients such as the US army and computer companies worldwide.
                <br>
                With criteria of constant improvement - improving product quality, at the end of 2013 Greystone Data Systems Vietnam continued to launch DF-X5 duplicators that can copy program software and data from one (01) Source hard disk drive to five (05) Target hard disk drives simultaneously. The machines are applied the chip of processor technology 28nm, improve user interface with capacitive touch screen 5.0 inches. Copying speeds are up to 16GB / min.

                DF-X5 HDD Duplicators
                HDD Duplicators are fully manufactured in Vietnam by the team of engineers in R & D department who are responsible for planning, designing and implementing. The outsourcing companies make the circuit boards and assemble are the local companies. Through a series of testing the product quality from the input to the output, we are confident the products meet the quality requirements of the most fastidious customers worldwide. To be prouder when the US army who is confident to use DFX HDD duplicators and our main clients during the past years.

                The main functions are integrated in DFX duplicatiors:
                Read any information of drives, including: Information of manufacturer, serial numbers, the speed standard of drives, capacity...
                Mirror Copy: Copy all data from the Source drive to Target drives with conditions that drives are similar to the numbers of cylinder, head, track & sector per track. The speed is up to 16GB / min (SATA 3).
                Smart Copy: Copy the system file structures and user data. Memory partition structure is held constantly, copy data according to the files, automatically change the partition size depending on the capacity of each Target drives. This function automatically skips the blank memory areas to help to reduce the time copying drives. It also allows to copy Source drives to the Target drives with different capacities.
                <br>
                DF-X11 Duplicators copy many hard disk drives at the same time.
                <br>
                Wipe Disk: Support users to erase data of hard disk drives with two algorithms: Fast Wipe Disk or DoD Wipe Out. The speed is up to 23GB / min (SATA 3).
                Partition Copy: Allow users to select the appropriate partition to copy data from the Source to the Target. The user interface will display a list of Partition in the Source for users to select.
                Fast Purge: be the function to erase the hard disk drives quickly. Erasure Speed of this function is higher than using Disk Wipe. The speed is up to 28GB / min (SATA 3).
                Mirror Verify: Support to test data of Mirror Copy from Source to Target.
                Smart Verify: Support to test data of Smart Copy from Source to Target.
                Wipe disk Verify: Support to test data in the Target that if it was erased successfully or not.
                Save logfile: Copy logfile of the system as text files. Information of logfile including Date / Time, the functions were performed, information of drives, operating status, operating time...
                Upgrade: This function helps users to update the latest software version for the device. Users can upgrade online via LAN or upgrade offline via USB.
                Besides this machine also provides the setting function for users to configure the system depending on the purpose of using, such as: Setup UDMA mode, Sectors per Transaction, LBA / INT-13 mode, Drive Time delay, Sound, Date / Time, ...

                Nowadays in market hard dish drives, interface SATA 1, 2 & 3 were born to replace for interface ATA that was outdated. SSD drives that were designed compactly and also gradually to replace HDD drives. So how can it support the users to copy hard disk drives with different interfaces on a single machine DFX? The engineers of R & D department have researched and created the adapter-boards that are suitable for each such interfaces. The Adapter-boards were designed for users to easily replace, assemble by hands on the surface of the machine without the assistance of technicians. Therefore, just a few actions for replacing the Adapter-boards that match the drives, users can copy many drives with different many interfaces.
