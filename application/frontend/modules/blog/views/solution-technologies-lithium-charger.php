                The Lithium Charger is designed to handle up to 16 batteries at one time. Batteries can all be the same or mixed models, each port will charge the battery independent of the other ports. Batteries used in today’s electronic devices have a larger capacity, the Lithium Charger will be able to handle these batteries up to 6000 mAh. The unique patented battery holder is designed to be easy to use and flexible. A “wake up” feature will put a quick high current charge on batteries that are “exhausted” or completely run down bringing the battery back to life. The target charge percentage is selectable to support your unique charging needs and times. Versatility of the Lithium Charger sets it apart from all other chargers on the market today.
