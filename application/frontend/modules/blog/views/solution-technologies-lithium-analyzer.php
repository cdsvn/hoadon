                The Lithium Analyzer is designed to run “stand-alone” to test 12 batteries simultaneously. The batteries may be all the same or all different. This system is capable of analyzing the large capacity (up to 6000 mAh) batteries that are used in today’s mobile devices. The system has an integrated function for protecting batteries and detecting the wrong electrode before and during the test. Fully self-contained analyzer has a 5 inch touch panel to control the type of test to run. <br>
                Quick Test: Test and report the results of battery status (State Of Health - SoH) within 3 minutes. <br>
                Long Test: Test and report SoH results of the batteries in approximately 3 hours with high accuracy. Charge: <br>
                Charge all kinds of Li-ion batteries with Designed Capacity up to 6000mAh. <br>
                Discharge: Discharge all kinds of Li-ion batteries with Designed Capacity up to 6000mAh. <br> 
                Refurbish: including the process of charging and discharging the batteries several times in order to increase the operational capability of the batteries that were not used for a long time. <br>
                Analyze: Analyze the characteristics of batteries in order to create profiles for QuickTest function. <br>
                Jump-Start: Activate the battery voltage was down.
